Analogues are ordered in decreasing order of similarity in a clockwise manner in the plot, starting with the most similar at the top. The similarity indices are annotated c (for chemistry) or b (for bioactivity) depending on the similarity context selected. Analogues may be identified using chemical descriptors or bioactivity descriptors. There are 3 different types of chemical descriptors included that are fingerprint representations of chemical structure - Morgan fingerprints, torsion fingerprints and chemotypes. Bioactivity descriptors make reference to a fingerprint representation of hitcalls from the ToxCast or Tox21 assays.

The view also provides information of the doses at which toxicity effects were observed by hovering over the boxes, which provide a means of assessing the validity of the analogues to determine which should be included in any read-across prediction. The data displayed can be filtered by specific effects or by setting thresholds for number of positives and negatives to be included in any prediction derived. The GenRA prediction is derived by clicking on the Run read-across button. Predictions and their associated confidence scores expressed as AUC values and their p-values can be displayed by hovering and the predictions are coloured coded in the same way as experimental results but by degrees of opacity. The opacity corresponds to how much confidence is associated with a prediction. The data matrix view and any generated predictions can be exported as a tsv or excel file by clicking on the export button.

As part of the NHANES, the CDC monitors biomarkers of chemical exposure (chiefly metabolites) in blood and urine to quantify the levels of chemical compounds present in U.S. residents (<a href=\'https://www.cdc.gov/exposurereport/\' target=\'_blank\'>link</a>). Each two-year study cycle comprises approximately 10,000 individuals, with exposure biomarker data for any given chemical available from only a subset of roughly 1/3 of the individuals in the study. In the 2024 publication “Characterizing Chemical Exposure Trends from NHANES Urinary Biomonitoring Data” (<a href=\'https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12188\' target=\'_blank\'>link</a>) EPA scientists inferred steady-state daily intake rates (mg/kg bodyweight/day) for 179 chemicals from the NHANES urine samples. All values in the table refer to the median U.S. population intake rate – the credible intervals reflect the uncertainty in the median estimate and do not characterize variability.',
